(x1, y1), (x2, y2)
Ax + By + C = 0

m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) if (x2-x1) != 0 else (1LL<<62) (inf)
y - y1 = m*(x-x1) = m*x - m*x1
b = -m*x1 + y1 (handle case where m = inf)

store m,b as fractions (num/den) in lowest terms

For each line, store a count c
c : (n choose 2) --> n
For n points, subtract out (n choose 3)
