Markdown for lists

-   One
-   Two
    -   Nested one
-   Three
    1.  Numerated list
    2.  No need to specify number

We can even inline math: $y = ax + b$.\
How about displayed equations:

$$
y = -2.2x + 0.5
$$

Subsection
----------

Just use Markdown to define sections and structure of the document.

Let's finish with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: I'm a footnote!
